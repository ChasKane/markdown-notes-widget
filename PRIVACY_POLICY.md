# Privacy Policy for Markdown Notes Widget

**Last Updated:** November 6, 2025

## Introduction

Markdown Notes Widget ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your data.

## Data Collection

**The App does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

The App operates entirely offline and does not:
- Connect to the internet
- Collect personal information
- Use analytics or tracking
- Share data with third parties
- Store data on external servers

## Local Data Storage

The App only stores data locally on your device:

1. **File URIs**: The App stores file URIs (references to files you select) in a local SQLite database on your device. This allows the App to remember which files you've added to widgets.

2. **No File Content Storage**: The App does NOT store the content of your files. It only stores references (URIs) to files you select.

3. **All Data Stays on Your Device**: All data stored by the App remains on your device and is never transmitted anywhere.

## File Access

The App uses Android's Storage Access Framework to access files you explicitly select:

- You choose which files to display in widgets
- The App requests permission to access only the specific files you select
- File access is handled through Android's standard file picker
- You can revoke file access at any time through Android's settings

## Permissions

The App does not request any special permissions. File access is handled through Android's standard document picker, which you control.

## Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any information from children. Since the App does not collect any data, this is not applicable.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.

## Contact

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at LawrenceCKane@gmail.com.

## Your Rights

Since the App does not collect or store personal data, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete. All data stored by the App (file URIs) can be removed by uninstalling the App.

**Summary**: This App is completely offline, does not collect any personal data, and all information stays on your device.
